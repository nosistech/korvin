We will acknowledge your report within **24 hours** and provide an estimated fix timeline.

## Response Times

## Credit
We publicly credit researchers who report valid vulnerabilities, with their consent, in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file and in release notes when appropriate.

## CVE Assignment
For qualifying vulnerabilities, we will request a CVE identifier from MITRE or another CNA.

## Coordinated Disclosure
We follow a coordinated disclosure model:
1. Researcher reports privately
2. We develop and test a patch
3. We release the patch and publish an advisory
4. Researcher may publish their findings after the patch is available

## Independent Review

## Scope
This policy applies to the core Korvin framework, including:

- Voice components
- Sandbox executor
- Dashboard (FastAPI)

The policy does not cover third-party services (LLM providers, messaging platforms, etc.), though we welcome reports of integration issues.

## Safe Harbor
We will not pursue legal action against researchers who comply with this policy. We consider good-faith security research to be authorized for this project.
